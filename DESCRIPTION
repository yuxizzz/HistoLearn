Description: HistoLearn provides a workflow for computational pathology that 
    integrates downstream analysis (including interpretation, visualization, 
    and modeling) of H&E embeddings generated from pathology foundation models. 
    It enables users to load H&E embeddings with their class labels, perform 
    dimensionality reduction, train classifiers, and evaluate performance. The 
    package implements a simple pipeline combining principal component analysis 
    (PCA) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN), inspired by the common workflows used 
    in pathology foundation models (Chen et al., 2024). HistoLearn offers an 
    all-in-one framework for the interpretation and predictive modeling of 
    high-dimensional histological embeddings.
