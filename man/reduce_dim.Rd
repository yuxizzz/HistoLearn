\title{Dimension Reduction Helper}
\usage{
reduce_dim(X, method = "pca", k = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix where rows represent samples and columns represent features.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the dimensionality reduction method.
Currently only \code{"pca"} is supported.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the number of components to retain.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{model} — the fitted PCA model.
\item \code{X_red} — the matrix of reduced-dimension features.
}
}
\description{
Performs dimensionality reduction on a numeric feature matrix.
Currently, only Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is implemented.
