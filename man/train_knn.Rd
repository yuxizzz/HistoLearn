\title{Train a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier}
\usage{
train_knn(X, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data frame of predictor variables (samples in rows,
features in columns).}

\item{y}{A factor or character vector of class labels corresponding to the
rows of \code{X}. Coerced internally to a factor.}
}
\value{
A fitted \code{\link[caret]{train}} object with \code{method = "knn"}, which
encapsulates the cross-validated k-NN model and tuning results.
}
\description{
Internal helper function that trains and tunes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)
classification model using the \pkg{caret} package. The predictors are
centered and scaled, and \code{k} is selected via cross-validation.
}
\note{
Documentation and code debugging processes were refined with the assistance
of ChatGPT-5 to improve accuracy and clarity.

The code is written by Yuxi Zhu and is turned into helper function by ChatGPT.
