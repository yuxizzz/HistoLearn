\title{Train a Multinomial Logistic Regression Classifier}
\usage{
train_logistic(X, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix or data frame of predictor variables (samples in rows,
features in columns).}

\item{y}{A factor or character vector of class labels corresponding to the
rows of \code{X}. Coerced internally to a factor.}
}
\value{
A fitted \code{\link[caret]{train}} object with \code{method = "multinom"},
whose \code{finalModel} component is an \code{\link[nnet]{multinom}} object.
}
\description{
Internal helper function that trains a multinomial logistic regression
classification model using the \pkg{caret} interface to
\code{\link[nnet]{multinom}} (via \code{method = "multinom"}). Predictors
are centered and scaled prior to fitting, and performance is estimated
using cross-validation.

\note{
Documentation and code debugging processes were refined with the assistance
of ChatGPT-5 to improve accuracy and clarity.
